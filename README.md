------------------
**Description (copied from FreeCodeCamp)**

> Create a web page (or multi-page web site or web application) that would be useful to someone learning the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Your imagination and initiative are the only limits.


**Tools**

- "vanilla" HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- absolutely no frameworks (no Bootstrap, jQuery, etc)


**Notes**

Implemented as a Tier 2 challenge:

> Tier 2 - you may only use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or code that can be transpiled to vanilla, such as Jade, TypeScript, or Sass) plus an external CSS reset and fonts for the frontend portion of your code. The intent is not to avoid Sass, etc, but rather to avoid Bootstrap, jQuery and the like. If you choose to include a backend for your project, the restriction does NOT extend to your backend code (for instance a purely backend framework such as Express would be allowable).
