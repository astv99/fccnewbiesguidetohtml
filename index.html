        <h3>Who This Guide Is For</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This guide is for "Campers" (FreeCodeCampers, that is) that may be either just
            starting out in the curriculum or are part-way through it, or are maybe even past the
            Front-End Development Certificate, to gain a better, more solid grounding in writing &
            understanding HTML. It's assumed that you have at least a little bit of beginning
            familiarity with HTML—at minimum, you should know what HTML is and how to write a very
            simple page with basic headers. If you have no previous experience with HTML at all,
            I'd recommend going through at least the first 3 lessons in FreeCodeCamp's <a 
            class="extLink" href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/map-aside#nested-collapseHTML5andCSS"
            >HTML5 and CSS</a> section before reading this guide.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The concept for this guide was motivated by FreeCodeCamp's <a class="extLink" href=
            "https://forum.freecodecamp.com/t/computer-frontend-web-development-challenge-november-16-to-26/"
            >Frontend Web Development Challenge - November 16 to 26</a>, which had only these
            requirements:</p>
            <blockquote>
              Create a web page (or multi-page web site or web application) that would be useful to
              someone learning the FreeCodeCamp curriculum. Your imagination and initiative are the
              only limits.
            </blockquote>
            <p>This page was implemented as a Tier 2 challenge: vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
            with absolutely no frameworks—no Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. You can view all code for this
            web page over at <a class="extLink" href="https://github.com/astv99/fccnewbiesguidetohtml"
            >my Github page</a>. Making this page mobile-compatible without Bootstrap and jQuery was
            a bit of a challenge, but I tried my best to make it look as good as I could.</p>

        <h3>About Me</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>My name is Steve Ham, and I go by "astv99" on the FCC forums. Like so
            many others before me, I found FCC because I wanted to learn Web development. However,
            my experience pre-FCC probably isn't the norm, as I'd already invested quite a bit of
            time & money into other MOOCs for Web development (Coursera, Udemy, and Lynda.com
            primarily), and I also have a long history with programming that goes all the way back
            to BASIC, C, and HTML4, all of which I learned in the 90s when I was a kid. So why did
            I get into FCC? Mostly because it was free, and I kept wanting to find the best learning
            resources for modern Web development, as I had no previous experience with HTML5, CSS,
            or JavaScript until 2015, to help make the transition towards a different career and
            broaden my skill set at the same time.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This guide is thus my attempt at coalescing the recent knowledge I've
            gained in Web development from all the sources I've used over the past year.</p>

      <h2 id="the-dom">The DOM (Document Object Model)</h2>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>What's the DOM?</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It's very important to know what the DOM is for two main reasons: (1) It'll help reinforce
            writing your HTML to be as valid and correct as possible and to avoid errors that can
            cause a variety of issues (primarily cross-browser compatibility), and (2) Having a solid
            knowledge of the DOM will also help you to write JavaScript later on, to control the behavior
            of your web pages. It's a shame that so many HTML tutorials and MOOCs on the Internet skip
            the topic of the DOM, as it's foundational to everything related to Web development. In
            short, knowing about the DOM will help you write better web pages.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To put it in as plain English as possible, the DOM is essentially a specification. The
            best real-world analogy might be to call it a type of assembly guide (like for furniture),
            complete with the manual and parts so that you can build something—a web page, in this case.
            Like any assembly guide, the DOM has a lot of built-in stuff with instructions that you
            can use for certain tasks. There's no "instruction manual" per se, but the DOM does provide
            an overview of how your web page should be formed from the top down, starting with the
            HTML tag, then the HEAD tag (and everything within it), and the BODY tag, along with
            everything within. The Wikipedia article on the DOM has a great <a 
            class="extLink"
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model#/media/File:DOM-model.svg"
            >visual diagram</a> that shows the flow and hierarchy of these tags/elements.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The DOM also provides the "base architecture" for these HTML tags/elements (HTML,
            HEAD, BODY, etc) and it's assumed that you'll fill them in on any web pages that you
            write from scratch. But before we proceed further, let's clarify some terminology. The
            term "HTML element" is not interchangeable with the term "HTML tag", as one is much more
            abstract than the other. <b>Elements</b> can be thought of as an abstract concept in
            terms of how you think about them, since you don't literally see them on your computer
            screen. But with respect to the DOM, elements are actually considered what's called a
            concrete "object" and can have certain properties and values associated with them, much
            like how a physical object in the real-world has a set of properties associated with it
            as well (like color and size for example). <b>Tags</b>, on the other hand, are literally
            just the text that you see on your screen, whether it's "html", "head", "body", or others
            like "h1", "a" (anchor), or "p" (paragraph). Note, however, that when you use the word
            "tag", it also includes the angle brackets &lt; and &gt;, so that you can specifically
            refer to either an opening or closing tag. For example, &lt;p&gt; is an opening tag,
            while &lt;/p&gt; is a closing tag. The opening and closing tags together are generally
            considered to form an element—i.e., most elements have an opening and closing tag (not
            all elements do, like &lt;img&gt; and &lt;br /&gt; for instance).</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Using that terminology then, I can further expand on the concept of the DOM by adding
            that it also includes the full possible set of HTML elements, which you can view a full
            list of on <a class="extLink" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element"
            >Mozilla's MDN site</a>. In a sense, you can consider the DOM as a sort of template as well,
            which has a whole lot of "fill-in-the-blank" spots that are your job to fill in as a Web
            developer. The blank spots are simply where you put in your HTML tags and the rest of your
            content.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>In a sense, the DOM is like an amalgamation of the assembly guide and template concepts,
            into a form that acts a lot like a skeleton—much like the human skeleton, where a finger
            attaches to your hand, your hand is attached to your arm, your arm is attached to your
            spinal cord, etc. In the same kind of way that all of the parts of your body are connected
            and branch out at the same time, the elements in the DOM can also be connected, and
            everything branches out from the root, which can be formally referred to as the <b>document</b>
            node. This document node is so formalized that you do actually and literally call it
            "document" whenever you use it, like in the function <code>document.getElementById()</code>,
            often used in JavaScript code. And the branching structure is so formalized as well that
            you can also think of elements to have "parents", "children", and "siblings", like in a
            family tree diagram. A parent element is naturally the element that's one level higher
            up than another, a child element is the element that's one level down from another, and
            sibling elements are all at the same level as each other.</p>

        <h3>Hierarchy &mdash; The Header Elements</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The header elements (<b>&lt;h1&gt;</b> through <b>&lt;h6&gt;</b>) define headers in your
            web page and help divide the page structure accordingly to break it down into segments.
            Even though their font sizes get progressively visually smaller, their function is for
            more than just visual appearance to act as sectional headers—the DOM actually uses the
            header elements to form a top-down hierarchy of your page structure.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Let's pause to think about this a moment, because this is an important detail, and newbies
            to HTML often mis-use these headers, inadvertently bungling the structure of their web
            pages and adversely affecting the search engine optimization (SEO) of their pages as well.
            Let's take the example of writing an essay on a topic, as most people have written essays
            in school before, so hopefully this is a familiar concept to everyone. Have you ever written
            an essay where you <em>didn't</em> put some thought into how you were going to structure it?
            I'm guessing the answer will be no for nearly everyone—in fact, writing essays is such a
            common assignment in school that there's even a formal structure for it: the intro, the body
            with 3 arguments, and the conclusion, right? So when someone else reads your essay, and they
            know how it's supposed to be structured, they know where to look in your essay for a
            specific point, like your thesis. And if anything is missing, they know that your essay
            is incomplete.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It's kind of like that with the HTML header elements as well. They're actually used to
            fill in spots in the DOM template that provide a formal structure for the page, or your
            "document", which I'll use going forward instead of the word "page", as "page" refers more
            to the visible thing you see in your browser while "document" refers more to the invisible
            behind-the-scenes in-the-computer object that's being "assembled" by your Web browser.
            If you <em>don't</em> put an &lt;h1&gt; in your HTML document, that's an error. You
            <em>should</em> put it in. This is where some newbies make their first mistake with the
            header tags, and think they can skip &lt;h1&gt; and start with &lt;h2&gt; or &lt;h3&gt;.
            But that's not correct, because is there anyone in the world who <em>doesn't</em> count
            starting at 1? Why would anyone start counting at 2 or 3, when that doesn't make sense?
            So it should make total sense to always start with the &lt;h1&gt; element in your document.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>This is also, however, where a second mistake can be made in thinking that you can place
            more than one &lt;h1&gt; in your document. But if you pause to think about it, that doesn't
            make sense either. The &lt;h1&gt; element is the top-level, highest-ranked header. &lt;h2&gt;
            through &lt;h6&gt; all fall below it in the hierarchy, so why would you place another
            &lt;h1&gt; in the same document? It can help to think of &lt;h1&gt; as the document label,
            or to put it another way, the page title. From a content point of view, it should basically
            mirror what's in the &lt;title&gt; tag for the page. So in the same way that you should
            change the &lt;title&gt; tag for each individual HTML file that you create, you should
            also change the &lt;h1&gt; tag for each HTML file as well. And then, from there, you can
            add any lower-hierarchy headers that you might need.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Some readers might be wondering at this point, do you <em>need</em> to use the header
            elements in every document that you create? My answer to that is: maybe not, but why not use
            them? I can't think of a good reason to never not use them, and there are plenty of good
            reasons to do so—they can make your page content easier to target via CSS (or JavaScript),
            easier to maintain as a Web developer (including by other developers), and easier to
            interpret by search engines, which will boost your SEO!</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
          </div>

        <h3>Accessibility &mdash; The &lt;em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt; tags</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>When we all start out building Web pages as developers, we tend to focus more on actually
            writing the code and less on how other people are going to read our content. It's only natural,
            after all, especially when a lot of tutorials and MOOCs rarely even bring up the issue of UI
            (User Interface) and UX (User eXperience). And you might even think, isn't that what Web
            <em>designers</em> are for? Why would I need to worry about that as a developer?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The truth is, unless you're working with a Web designer, and even if you already are,
            paying careful attention to the UI and UX that you create is equally as important as your
            code. Because no one is going to want to read your content, as great as it may be, if they
            have any difficulties reading it. What sort of difficulties, you might ask? Let's consider
            some possibilities—some people don't have perfect 20/20 vision and may need to use magnification
            on your Web page if something appears too small, others may have motor control issues and may
            have trouble typing on a computer keyboard, others may be color-blind and may not be able
            to see certain colors, and others could even be totally blind and unable to see but still
            have full function of their other senses. What does this mean? It means you should remember
            to make your content <em>accessible</em> for people who have a disability. And you might
            be wondering, how do disabled people access the Web? They can do it through a variety of
            ways, but a common one is by using what's called a <a class="extLink" href=
            "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader">screen reader</a>, which is software that
            takes the visual content on the Web and "translates" it into auditory content for people
            who may be visually-impaired in some way.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>With this in mind then, I'll try to address one of the most common mistakes that I've
            seen HTML newbies make, which is improper use of the <b>&lt;em&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b>,
            <b>&lt;i&gt;</b>, and <b>&lt;b&gt;</b> tags. First, just a bit of history here. The &lt;i&gt;
            and &lt;b&gt; tags have been around since the inception of HTML, and were originally for 
            developers to simply italicize and bolden text. They were commonly used as "presentational"
            visual cues, in order to visually show differences in the text. However, if you pause to
            think about it, italic and bold text can have a lot of different uses on not only a computer
            screen but also on paper. If you're writing citations for a report, italics can denote the
            title of a book, movie, magazine, etc. And bold text can denote sectional headers, labels,
            or an arbitrary word that you just want to emphasize. This is all stuff that most people
            already know, or should know. But what happens when you're transcribing speech to text? Or
            writing a story? When it comes to speech in the English language, people naturally tend to
            emphasize certain words over others in certain scenarios, and placing emphasis on a
            different word can totally change the meaning of a sentence.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>As an example, let's take the sentence "What are you doing?" This is a very common saying
            in the English language, but it can take on entirely meanings in different situations.
            Imagine emphasis on the first word, and say it out loud: "<em>What</em> are you doing?" How
            about the second word instead: "What <em>are</em> you doing?" Or the third word: "What are
            <em>you</em> doing?" Or the last word: "What are you <em>doing</em>?" Did you notice how the
            question dramatically changed tone depending on which word was emphasized? The first two forms
            could be considered friendly, almost conversational, but the latter two took on a decidedly
            accusatory tone and anxious tone, respectively, right? So as you just saw from this example,
            it's possible to either capture or set a certain tone depending on which word you emphasize
            in a sentence.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And that sort of instance is exactly where you should use the <b>&lt;em&gt;</b> tag. The
            &lt;em&gt; tag is short for "emphasis", which means exactly what you think it means, emphasis
            of the contained text. The reason you should use the &lt;em&gt; tag is for screen readers,
            which will vocalize that word a bit differently when they read it aloud, which will further
            help a disabled person to understand the meaning of your content. Of course, if you
            <em>don't</em> want a screen reader to vocalize a certain word differently, then that's where
            you use the standard &lt;i&gt; tag instead, since it's strictly visual and won't change
            the meaning of your content.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>The <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b> tag is very similarly used, except its meaning is for words
            that should have a very strong emphasis, sort of like a verbal command, or a severe warning,
            or other similarly strong words, like for example, "Stop!" or "Fire!" for instance. And
            similarly, if you <strong>don't</strong> want a screen reader to vocally emphasize the word,
            just use the &lt;b&gt; tag. The &lt;b&gt; tag is for all other strictly-visual purposes
            when it comes to bold text.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>To summarize this section, always use the <b>&lt;em&gt;</b> and <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b>
            tags whenever you want to appropriately emphasize certain words for disabled people using
            screen readers, and <em>only</em> then as well, because you sure don't want to leave any
            unintentional usages that may cause a disabled person to get confused. In all other
            instances, stick to using the &lt;i&gt; and &lt;b&gt; tags.</p>

        <h3>HTML First</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you've been on the Web for any length of time, you may have heard the saying that
            "Content is king." In the context of Web development, it basically means that your page
            content is the most important asset, because if your page content isn't compelling for at
            least one person, what's the point of building it? This relates to the concept of "HTML First"
            because your HTML code <em>is</em> your content. Or, to put it more accurately, your content
            is <em>in</em> your HTML files. So if we're going with the content-first approach, it means
            that you should build your content first. What does this mean exactly?</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Basically, it means that you should start forming your content independently of the
            HTML code. If you plan on doing any lengthy writing, you may want to consider writing it
            up in a word processing application (like Microsoft Word, Apple Pages, Google Docs, etc)
            first, because after all, where else are you going to find convenient features like spell
            or grammar check? If you're going to be building a more visual- or media-oriented web page,
            then why not plan out the design of how it's going to look and act before you ever write
            a single line of code? This level of attention to pre-planning your content will do two
            things: (1) it'll help make you certain of which assets you're actually going to use and
            might not use, (2) it'll give you a concrete idea of what you'll need to do once you hit
            the Web development stage. Basically, it's all about design before development.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>And then, once you have your assets and a concept of your design, then you can begin
            to translate all of your content to HTML, and HTML only. Don't skip any steps and try to
            do any CSS first or at the same time, or add any JavaScript yet. All of that can come
            afterwards. The more important thing is to create all of your HTML first, and get it all
            on the virtual page. Then, once you have all of the HTML down, you can begin the second
            phase, which is CSS, followed by the third phase, which is JavaScript. This is the
            most-often recommended path to take when building a web site, and I can't recommend it
            myself enough either: HTML first, CSS second, and JavaScript third.</p>

        <h3>Sizing Text (CSS)</h3>

          <div class="justify">
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Although the subject of CSS is beyond the scope of this guide, I wanted to briefly
            cover the subject of sizing text, because it's one of the most common things that I've
            seen newbies inadvertently make a mistake doing, because there's no good material on the
            Web that really covers this subject properly. There are 3 main ways to size text on the Web,
            and as a Web developer it helps to be aware of all of them so you know when to use each one,
            and when <em>not</em> to use each one, because they all have their pros and cons. In no
            particular order, you can size by: pixels, ems, or percentage.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Pixels</b>: Setting font size by pixels is by far the most common way to set a font
            size, but it's also by far the most problematic. Why? Because pixels are not created equally
            on all computer and device screens. Take for example my particular Android smartphone, the
            Motorola Moto E 2<sup>nd</sup> Gen, which has a display resolution of 540x960 and has a density
            of 245 ppi (pixels per inch). Compare that to the current state-of-the-art 4K monitors, which
            top out at a resolution of 4000x2000 and thus have a much higher ppi. The pixels on a
            4K monitor are going to be much smaller, as you'd expect, and what you think might be a
            normal 16-pixel font could end up looking extra tiny on a 4K monitor. So as you can see,
            you can't size by pixels all the time for all displays. Sure, you could use CSS media
            queries to adjust by resolution, but that'd be an extremely inefficient solution. What
            should you consider using instead? Ems, which are covered next.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Ems</b>: If you haven't heard of ems before, you're not alone, because it's not often
            brought up in HTML or CSS tutorials. An 'em' is a single unit of measurement that changes
            size depending on the display resolution and browser settings. Basically, you can think of
            1 em to mean both the width, and height, of the capital letter 'M' in the default font and
            size of your Web browser. For most Web browsers, that default size tends to be 16 at medium
            resolutions, but the size can vary, and you can manually override it as well. In most cases,
            though, 1 em turns out to be the height & width of the capital 'M', usually in Times New
            Roman, at a size of 16 (at medium resolutions). So, setting your font size at 1 em
            essentially means that you want the default font size from the Web browser, and doing it
            that way ensures that your text will be readable on all devices, because naturally the
            default size will be smaller on a lower-resolution display and larger on a higher-resolution
            display. And increasing your font size by ems will ensure that all of your text scales up
            appropriately. How do you use ems? Notationally it's very similar to pixels, you just write
            it like this (note that there's no space between the number and unit):
            <code>font-size: 1em</code>. Ems can be fractional, so if you need to use a value between
            1 and 2, or 2 and 3, just add a single value after the decimal point: <code>1.2em</code>
            or <code>2.4em</code>. You can also use values between 0 and 1 to reduce size, like:
            <code>0.8em</code> for instance.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>For more info on ems, the W3 site has a lot of in-depth info on it in <a class="extLink"
            href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/css2em.htm">Chapter 4</a> of the WAI.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><b>Percentage</b>: Another widely used method of sizing text, it's likely that you're
            probably already familiar with this. Like ems, using percentages is a responsive technique
            as well, but it's a bit less intuitive to use, and ends up having a few quirks that make it
            a bit problematic to use (like in nested elements). If you're using percentages, it's
            usually best to limit where you use them, as the technique can have unintended side effects.</p>

            <p>It's so easy to check your HTML code these days that there's really no good excuse for
            <em>not</em> doing it. Here's a brief list of some resources that you should either note
            or bookmark and use often on every Web page that you build from now on:</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>It's just as easy these days to check how your page renders that there's no good excuse

            for possible display issues in other browsers. Here are the major Web browsers that you
